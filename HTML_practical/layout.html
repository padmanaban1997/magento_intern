						    <p id="a1">Machine Learning (ML) is an important aspect of modern business and research. It uses algorithms and neural network models to assist computer systems in progressively improving their performance. Machine Learning algorithms automatically build a mathematical model using sample data – also known as “training data” – to make decisions without being specifically programmed to make those decisions.

							Machine Learning is, in part, based on a model of brain cell interaction. The model was created in 1949 by Donald Hebb in a book titled The Organization of Behavior (PDF). The book presents Hebb’s theories on neuron excitement and communication between neurons.

							Hebb wrote, “When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.” Translating Hebb’s concepts to artificial neural networks and artificial neurons, his model can be described as a way of altering the relationships between artificial neurons (also referred to as nodes) and the changes to individual neurons. The relationship between two neurons/nodes strengthens if the two neurons/nodes are activated at the same time and weakens if they are activated separately. The word “weight” is used to describe these relationships, and nodes/neurons tending to be both positive or both negative are described as having strong positive weights. Those nodes tending to have opposite weights develop strong negative weights (e.g. 1×1=1, -1x-1=1, -1×1=-1).

						

							Machine Learning the Game of Checkers

							Arthur Samuel of IBM developed a computer program for playing checkers in the 1950s. Since the program had a very small amount of computer memory available, Samuel initiated what is called alpha-beta pruning. His design included a scoring function using the positions of the pieces on the board. The scoring function attempted to measure the chances of each side winning. The program chooses its next move using a minimax strategy, which eventually evolved into the minimax algorithm.

							Samuel also designed a number of mechanisms allowing his program to become better. In what Samuel called rote learning, his program recorded/remembered all positions it had already seen and combined this with the values of the reward function. Arthur Samuel first came up with the phrase “Machine Learning” in 1952.</p>
